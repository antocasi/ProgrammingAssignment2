## The two functions below are useful to avoid repeating the calculation of the inverse of a matrix of  
## interest. The inverse matrix is stored in the cache and retreived if necessary.

## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## The cacheSolve function computes the inverse of the matrix created above and checks if the inverse has
## already been calculated. In that case the result is retreived from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
